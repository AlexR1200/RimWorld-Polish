RimWorld-Templates
==================

A list of translate-ready files in the correct syntax.

I generated them using a python script so there may be things missing or incorrect. I was more safe than sorry, so I made sure these templates don't generate any errors in game.

I've included the script here too: https://github.com/Sakuukuli/RimWorld-Templates/blob/master/RimWorld_DefsToDefinjecteds.py
