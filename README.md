RimWorld-Templates
==================

A list of translate-ready files in the correct syntax.

__Not updated for alpha 8 yet.__

I generated them using a python script so there may be things missing or incorrect. I was more safe than sorry, so I made sure these templates don't generate any errors in game.

I've included the script here too: [RimWorld_DefsToDefinjecteds.py](../master/RimWorld_DefsToDefinjecteds.py)
